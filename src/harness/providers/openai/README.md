# harness::providers::openai

Real OpenAI Chat Completions provider (feature `openai`). This is one of the
concrete leaves the recursive runtime bottoms out in: a single `OpenAiModel`
backs hosted OpenAI *and* every OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Anthropic
compatibility, Ollama, DeepSeek, Groq, xAI, OpenRouter, Together, Mistral) via
the preset constructors, so the sub-agent / sub-graph layers above never need
to know which provider actually answered.

## What it does

`OpenAiModel` implements `ChatModel` against `POST {base_url}/chat/completions`.
It:

1. Translates the provider-neutral `ModelRequest` into OpenAI's JSON wire
   format (message content blocks, tool schemas, tool choice, response format,
   image content parts).
2. Performs the HTTP call with a shared, reusable `reqwest::Client` (unary or
   streamed).
3. Maps the response back into a `ModelResponse` with a fully populated
   `AssistantMessage`, `ToolCall`s, `Usage`, and finish reason — or, for
   streaming, a `ModelStream` of `ModelStreamItem`s.

The wire (de)serialization shapes live in `types.rs`; `transport.rs`,
`convert.rs`, and `sse.rs` own the HTTP transport, request/response
translation, and SSE decoding respectively, keeping OpenAI-specific JSON out
of the rest of the harness.

## Construction

- `OpenAiModel::new(api_key)` — bare constructor, hosted OpenAI base URL and
  `DEFAULT_MODEL` (`gpt-4.1-mini`).
- `.with_model(..)` / `.with_provider(..)` / `.with_base_url(..)` — builder
  overrides.
- `OpenAiModel::from_env()` — reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required) and optional
  `OPENAI_MODEL` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.
- `OpenAiModel::from_spec(spec, api_key)` / `from_spec_env(spec)` — build from a
  `providers::ProviderSpec` (base URL, default model, provider id already
  resolved).
- **Compatibility presets** — thin wrappers over `new` + `with_base_url` +
  `with_model` for endpoints that speak the same Chat Completions wire format:
  `compatible(base_url, model)` / `compatible_provider(..)` (arbitrary
  endpoint), `deepseek`, `anthropic` (compat endpoint, not the native
  Anthropic API), `groq`, `xai`, `openrouter`, `together`, `mistral`, `ollama`.
  Override the preset's default model with `.with_model(..)`.

Accessors: `.model()`, `.provider()`, `.base_url()`.

## Model discovery

`list_models()` calls `GET {base_url}/models` with the same credentials as
chat calls. Every OpenAI-compatible endpoint serves the same shape, so this
doubles as runtime model discovery for local/self-hosted providers (Ollama,
Together, Groq, OpenRouter, ...); returned ids can be fed straight into
`.with_model(..)`.

## Streaming (SSE)

Streaming responses are decoded by a small state machine (`SseState` /
`OpenAiStreamAcc` in `sse.rs`) built on `futures::stream::unfold`:

- Bytes are accumulated across chunk boundaries and only lossily decoded once
  a complete line is available, so a multi-byte UTF-8 character split across
  two HTTP chunks is never corrupted into replacement characters.
- Index-less streamed tool-call fragments (some providers omit the tool-call
  index on continuation chunks) are correlated by id rather than position.
- A trailing partial line without a final newline (providers that terminate
  the last SSE event without a trailing newline) is still flushed.
- Mid-stream error payloads (`data: {"error": ...}`) surface as a stream error
  instead of being silently swallowed.

## Local-server compatibility

Local OpenAI-compatible runtimes (LM Studio, llama.cpp server, and others)
implement a stricter subset of the Chat Completions request surface than hosted
OpenAI and reject two request shapes with an HTTP 400:

- **Named `tool_choice`** — `{"type":"function","function":{"name":...}}` is
  refused (`Invalid tool_choice type: 'object'`); only `none`/`auto`/`required`
  are accepted.
- **`response_format: {"type":"json_object"}`** — refused
  (`'response_format.type' must be 'json_schema' or 'text'`).

The provider degrades both without dropping semantics:

- A named tool choice becomes `tool_choice: "required"` **and** the wire `tools`
  array is filtered down to just the named tool, so the model still has exactly
  one tool to call. If the named tool is not in the list, `tools` is left intact
  and `"required"` is still sent.
- A `json_object` response format becomes a permissive `json_schema`
  (`{"name":"json_object","schema":{"type":"object"},"strict":false}`), which
  still guarantees a JSON object.

Two knobs control this per instance (default `true` = the hosted-OpenAI shapes):

- `.with_named_tool_choice(false)` — always degrade named tool choice.
- `.with_json_object_format(false)` — always degrade `json_object`.

**Zero-config auto-degrade:** even with the knobs left on, a first attempt that
fails with an HTTP 400 whose error body implicates `tool_choice` (for a named
tool-choice request) or `response_format` (for a `json_object` request) is
retried **once** with the offending shape degraded. The retry covers both the
unary and streaming paths, and never loops — at most one degraded retry per
call, and only for the shape the request actually used. This means unmodified
`from_env()` / preset instances "just work" against LM Studio and friends
without any per-provider configuration.

## Error handling

Non-2xx responses are normalized through `parse_error_body` / `provider_error`
into a structured `ProviderError` (HTTP status, provider error code, and a
`retryable` flag derived from the status: 408/409/429/5xx are retryable,
everything else — including 401/400 — is not) and surfaced as
`TinyAgentsError::Provider`, so `harness::retry::is_retryable` can classify
retryability instead of retrying every provider failure indiscriminately.
Transport-level failures (connection errors, body-read failures) have no such
structure to preserve and surface as a plain `TinyAgentsError::Model` string
via `provider_failure_message`. Malformed JSON bodies surface as
`TinyAgentsError::Serialization`.

## Operational constraints

- `DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS` (30s) bounds TCP connection establishment on
  every call, including streaming, without capping response body time.
- `DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` (600s) is an overall timeout applied to
  **unary** calls only when `ModelRequest::timeout_ms` is unset; streaming
  calls get no overall cap by default — callers relying on a hard streaming
  deadline must set `timeout_ms` explicitly or enforce one externally.
- o-series models (`o1`, `o3`, ...) require `max_completion_tokens` instead of
  `max_tokens`; this is handled internally based on the model id.
- The client is reused across calls for connection pooling — construct one
  `OpenAiModel` per logical provider/account rather than per request.
